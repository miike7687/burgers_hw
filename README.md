### Description

- Using mySQL, handlebars, express, and Node, I've created a full-stack application to keep track of a menu of burgers.

### Installation

- Through node

### Usage

- By having a menu of burgers that the user can DEVOUR and re-stock after they've devoured it. There is also an option to create a new burger with brand new ingredients. Furthermore, there's an opportunity to modify burgers' ingredients based on dietary needs. Finally, there is an opportunity for a manager to delete a burger if it's not selling well.

### License

### Contributing

- By continuing to make edits, update the style, and add more functionality for a burger of the week area.

### Tests
